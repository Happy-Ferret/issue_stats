  Many people value a healthy, active community as an important part of
  a programming language's value. Most people want to know that if bugs
  and issues come up, enough other people will also care enough that the
  issue will get resolved.

  While creating this application, I was curious about whether various metadata
  about a project was related to the time it would take to close a Github issue.
  I built these charts to visualize the relationship between different attributes,
  and I display the calculated
  = r2
  underneath each chart. For most of these charts, the
  = r2
  is below
  = succeed "," do
    %code 0.1
  meaning there is no linear relationship.
