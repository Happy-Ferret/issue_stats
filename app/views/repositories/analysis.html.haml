  Many people value a healthy, active community as an important part of
  a programming language's value. Most people want to know that if bugs
  and issues come up, enough other people will also care enough that the
  issue will get resolved.

  Way in the front (as of this writing) we have
  = succeed "." do
    %code Swift
  This language was just introduced in 2014, and the programmers involved in
  those open source communities are moving quickly and don't have time to
  wait around for long-lasting issues. In second place is
  %code Go
  , which appeared to in 2009 and is similarly young compared to
  most popular programming languages.

  - r2 = "r<sup>2</sup>".html_safe
  While creating this application, I was curious about whether various metadata
  about a project was related to the time it would take to close a Github issue.
  I built these charts to visualize the relationship between different attributes,
  and I display the calculated
  = r2
  underneath each chart. For each of these charts, the
  = r2
  is below
  = succeed "," do
    %code 0.1
  meaning there is no linear relationship between any of these attributes.
